In the second project, we will dive deeper into HTML by focusing on two important components: Tables and Forms. Tables are used to present data in a structured format, while forms are essential for user input and data submission. Throughout this project, you will learn to use the following HTML elements:

Table Tag: <table>
Table Row Tag: <tr>
Table Header Cell Tag: <th>
Table Data Cell Tag: <td>
Form Tag: <form>
Input Tags: <input> (various types), <textarea>, <select>, <option>, <label>, <button>
By the end of this project, you will be proficient in creating tables and forms, and you'll understand how to collect user input and process it.
